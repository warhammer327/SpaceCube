# SpaceCube
*It is an unity game project that is similar to arcade games. The player has to navigate the road avoiding the obstacles.*
___
### How to install
I have not added any installer yet. So, open the project on unity, then ```Files```>```Build Settings```>```Build```. So, far it can be played on computer so choose one between Linux, macOS or windows. 

### How to Play 
Open the ```.exe``` file on windows, ```./thenameyouput``` for Linux. To navigate around, use ```a``` and ```d```. Pressing ```a``` will steer the cube left, ```d``` will steer the cube right.
